## Description

Add a more detailed description of what your project entails and set out to do.

The project for the Community Science Museum was my second project as a front end development student, and also my biggest project so far. The brief for the Community Science Museum was that they were to open a science museum nearby, and wanted to catch the interest of younger people with their design of the website. 

My thoughts on the design are that I wanted to keep the design clean and interesting, which I really got to work by creating the cool logo, and keeping the different sites on the website interesting with its colors, images and general design. 

Here I am still kind of new into coding, but I am expanding my knowledge within HTML and CSS, and am exploring when it comes to the design process in Figma. Now I am really starting to understand responsiveness, WCAG guidelines, clean design and so on, which is very fun!

## Built With

- Figma (for design)
